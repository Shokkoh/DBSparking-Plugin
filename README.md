## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features

This plugin integrates a variety of systems to enhance the gameplay experience and server administration:

* üöÄ **Booster System:**
    * **Personal Boosters:** Grant TP bonuses to specific players for a set duration. The timer only counts down when the player is online.
    * **Global Boosters:** Activate a TP bonus for all players on the server.
    * **Rank Boosters:** Provide an exclusive TP bonus for players with a specific rank (requires LuckPerms or Vault).
    * Boosters are persistent and saved in a database (SQLite/MySQL).

* ‚öîÔ∏è **Stats Item System:**
    * Create items with custom DBC stat bonuses (STR, DEX, CON, etc.).
    * Add fixed values (`+100`), multipliers (`x1.5`), or percentage-based bonuses (`+10%`).
    * Define **level** or **rank** requirements to equip items.
    * Specify whether an item grants stats only when held (weapons) or in armor slots (armors).
    * Add custom lore to each item.
    * Anti-drop system to prevent items from being transferred without permission.

* üîß **Player Data Management:**
    * `/dbsp data` command to delete player data from other mods (DBC, CustomNPCs), ideal for fixing bugs or clearing profiles.
    * Confirmation system to prevent accidental deletions.
  
* üéÅ **Custom Items System:**
    * Create items that execute commands when used or right-clicked.
    * Define custom names, lores, damage and messages for these items.
    * Includes a GUI for easy item creation.
  
* ‚å®Ô∏è **Execute As Player Command:**
    * `/dbsp eap <player> <command>` to run commands as another player, useful for administrative tasks.
    * Also can send chat messages as the target player, and execute commands even if the player doesn't have permission to that command.
  
* üîê **Auto-Login System:**
    * Allows players to log in automatically after their first manual login if they link their IP address with their Nickname and prove they own the account by imputing their password.
    * Very useful for servers that don't use online mode, as it prevents account theft.
    * If the player changes their IP, or someone tries to join with their accounts, they will need to log in manually again.

* üîó **Integrations:**
    * **PlaceholderAPI:** Exposes a wide variety of data (DBC stats, active boosters, etc.) for use in other plugins like scoreboards or tabs.
    * **AuthMe/AuthMeReloeaded:** Integrates the Auto-Login system with AuthMe, allowing players to log in automatically after their first manual login.
    * **LuckPerms/Vault:** Integrates the Rank Booster system with these plugins to provide exclusive TP bonuses based on player ranks.
